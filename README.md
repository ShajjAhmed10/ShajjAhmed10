# Hi, I'm Sharjeel 👋

### 🧠 Psychology Graduate | 🤖 Aspiring AI Researcher | 📊 Computational Social Scientist

I am bridging the gap between **Human Behavioral Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**. With a Master’s background in Psychology, I am currently on an 8-month intensive journey to master the computational tools required to analyze social dynamics, sentiment, and human-computer interaction at scale.

## 🚀 My Current Focus
I am currently in **Phase 1** of my technical roadmap:
- 🐍 **Languages:** Python (Advanced logic & Data structures)
- 📈 **Data Tools:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for Behavioral Data Analysis
- 🌐 **Web:** Scraping social data for research purposes

## 🧪 The "Social-AI" Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundations** - Python & Web Scraping (Current)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Statistics & Neural Nets** - PyTorch & Experimental Design
- [ ] **Phase 3: NLP & Transformers** - Word Embeddings & Sentiment Analysis
- [ ] **Phase 4: GenAI & Deployment** - AWS Bedrock & Kubernetes

## 🔬 Research Interests
- **Affective Computing:** Using NLP to understand the "Politics of Feelings."
- **Social AI:** How LLMs simulate human social interactions.
- **Ethics & Bias:** Identifying and mitigating bias in psychometric AI models.
